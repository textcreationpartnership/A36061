         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the beginning of the ble≈ø≈øed Reformation, our wi≈øe and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ance≈øtors took care to ≈øet forth an Order for Redre≈ø≈øe of many things, which they, then, by the VVord di≈øcovered to be Vain, Erroneous, Super≈øtitious, and Idolatrous, in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique VVor≈øhip of God. This occa≈øioned many Godly and Learned men to rejoyce much in the Book of Common-Prayer at that time ≈øet forth; Becau≈øe the Ma≈ø≈øe, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51481:5"/>the re≈øt of the Latine-Service being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the Publique VVor≈øhip was celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our own Tongue; many of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People al≈øo received benefit by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures read in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which formerly were unto them as a Book that is ≈øealed.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, long and ≈øad Experience hath made it manife≈øt, That the Leiturgie u≈øed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (notwith≈øtanding all the pains and Religious intentions of the Compilers of it) hath proved an offence, not only to many of the Godly at home; but al≈øo to the Reformed Churches abroad. For, not to ≈øpeak of urging the Reading of all the Prayers, which very greatly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed the burden of it; the many unprofitable and burden≈øome Ceremonies, contained in it, have occa≈øioned much mi≈øchief, as well by di≈øquieting the Con≈øciences of many godly Mini≈øters and people who could not<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51481:5"/>yield unto them, as by depriving them of the Ordinances of God, which they might not enjoy without conforming or Sub≈øcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to tho≈øe Ceremonies. Sundry good Chri≈øtians have been by means thereof, kept from the Lords Table, and divers able and faithfull Mini≈øters debarred from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øe of their Mini≈øtery (to the endangering of many Thou≈øand Souls, in a time of ≈øuch ≈øcarcity of faithfull Pa≈øtors) and ≈øpoiled of their livelyhood, to the undoing of them and their Families. Prelates and their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction have laboured to rai≈øe the E≈øtimation of it to ≈øuch an height, as if there were no other VVor≈øhip, or way of VVor≈øhip of God among≈øt us, but onely the Service-Book; to the great hinderance of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the VVord, and (in ≈øome places, e≈øpecially of late) to the ju≈øtling of it out, as unnece≈ø≈øary; or (at be≈øt) as far inferior to the Reading of Common-Prayer, which<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51481:6"/>was made no better then an Idol by many Ignorant and Super≈øtitious People, vvho plea≈øing them≈øelves in their pre≈øence at that Service, and their Lip-labour in bearing a part in it, have thereby hardened them≈øelves in their ignorance and carele≈øne≈ø≈øe of ≈øaving knowledge and true piety.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Papi≈øts boa≈øted, that the Book was a compliance with them in a great part of their Service, and ≈øo were not a little confirmed in their Super≈øtition and Idolatry, expecting rather our return to them, than endeavouring the Reformation of them≈øelves: In which expectation they were of late very much incouraged, when, upon the pretended warrantablene≈ø≈øe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing of the former Ceremonies, new ones were dayly obtruded upon the Church.</p>
            <p>Adde hereunto (which was not fore≈øeen, but ≈øince hath come to pa≈ø≈øe) that the Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie hath been a great means, as on the

            <p>It is pre≈øuppo≈øed (according to the Rules for Ordination) that the Mini≈øter of Chri≈øt is<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51481:18"/>in ≈øome good mea≈øure gifted for ≈øo weighty a ≈øervice, by his skill in the Originall Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and in ≈øuch Arts and Sciences as are handmaids unto Divinity, by his knowledge in the whole Body of Theology, but mo≈øt of all in the holy Scriptures, having his ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes and heart exerci≈øed in them above the common ≈øort of Beleevers; and by the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination of Gods Spirit, and other gifts of edification, which (together with read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ≈øtudying of the Word) hee ought ≈øtill to ≈øeek by Prayer, and an humble heart, re≈øolving to admit and receive any truth not yet attained, when ever God ≈øhall make it known unto him. All which hee is to make u≈øe of, and improve, in his private prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, before hee deliver in publike what he hath provided.</p>
            <p>Ordinarily, the ≈øubject of his Sermon is to be ≈øome Text of Scripture, holding forth ≈øome principle or head of Religion; or ≈øui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to ≈øome ≈øpeciall occa≈øion emergent; or hee may goe on in ≈øome Chapter, P≈øalme, or Booke of the holy Scripture, as hee ≈øhall ≈øee fit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:51481:18"/>Let the Introduction to his Text be brief and per≈øpicuous, drawn from the Text it ≈øelf, or context, or ≈øome parallel place, or generall ≈øentence of Scripture.</p>
            <p>If the Text be long (as in Hi≈øtories and Parables it ≈øometimes mu≈øt be) let him give a briefe ≈øumme of it; if ≈øhort, a Paraphra≈øe thereof, if need be: In both, looking dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to the ≈øcope of the Text, and poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the chief heads and grounds of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which he is to rai≈øe from it.</p>
            <p>In Analy≈øing and dividing his Text, hee is to regard more the order of matter, then of words; and neither to burden the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the hearers in the beginning, with too many members of Divi≈øion, nor to trouble their minds with ob≈øcure termes of Art.</p>
            <p>In rai≈øing Doctrines from the Text, his care ought to bee, Fir≈øt, that the matter be the truth of God. Secondly, that it be a truth contained in, or grounded on that Text, that the hearers may di≈øcern how God tech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it from thence. Thirdly, that he chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in≈øi≈øt upon tho≈øe Doctrines which are<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51481:19"/>principally intended, and make mo≈øt for the edification of the hearers.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine is to be expre≈ø≈øed in plaine termes; or if any thing in it need explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to bee opened, and the con≈øequence al≈øo from the Text cleared. The parallel places of Scripture confirming the Doctrine are rather to bee plaine and pertinent, then many, and (if need bee) ≈øomewhat in≈øi≈øted upon, and applyed to the purpo≈øe in hand.</p>
            <p>The Arguments or Rea≈øons are to bee ≈øolid; and, as much as may bee, convincing. The illu≈øtrations of what kind ≈øoever, ought to bee full of light, and ≈øuch as may convey the truth into the Hearers heart with ≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall delight.</p>
            <p>If any Doubt, obvious from Scripture, Rea≈øon, or Prejudice of the Hearers, ≈øeem to ari≈øe, it is very requi≈øite to remove it, by reconciling the ≈øeeming differences, an≈øwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the rea≈øons, and di≈øcovering and taking away the cau≈øes of prejudice and mi≈øtake. Otherwi≈øe, it is not fit to detain the hearers with propounding or an≈øwering vaine or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51481:19"/>wicked Cavils, which as they are endle≈ø≈øe, ≈øo the propounding and an≈øwering of them doth more hinder then promote edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Hee is not to re≈øt in generall Doctrine, although never ≈øo much cleared and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but to bring it home to ≈øpeciall U≈øe, by application to his hearers: Which albeit it prove a worke of great difficulty to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, requiring much prudence, zeale, and meditation, and to the naturall and corrupt man will bee very unplea≈øant; yet hee is to endeavour to perform it in ≈øuch a manner that his Auditors may feele the Word of God to bee quick and powerfull, and a di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart; and that if any unbeleever or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant per≈øon bee pre≈øent, hee may have the ≈øecrets of his heart made manife≈øt, and give glory to God.</p>
            <p>In the U≈øe of In≈øtruction or information in the knowledge of ≈øome truth, which is a con≈øequence from his Doctrine, he may (when convenient) confirm it by a few firm Arguments from the Text in hand, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51481:20"/>places of Scripture, or from the nature of that Common place in Divinity, whereof that truth is a branch.</p>
            <p>In Confutation of fal≈øe Doctrines, he is neither to rai≈øe an old Here≈øie from the grave, nor to mention a bla≈øphemous opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unnece≈ø≈øarily: but if the people be indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of an Errour, he is to confute it ≈øoundly, and endeavour to ≈øatisfie their judgements and con≈øciences again≈øt all objections.</p>
            <p>In Exhorting to Duties, he is, as he ≈øeeth cau≈øe, to teach al≈øo the meanes that helpe to the performance of them.</p>
            <p>In Dehortation, Reprehen≈øion, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Admonition (which require ≈øpeciall wi≈øedome) let him, as there ≈øhall be cau≈øe, not only di≈øcover the nature and greatne≈ø≈øe of the ≈øin, with the mi≈øery attending it, but al≈øo ≈øhew the danger his hearers are in to be overtaken and ≈øurprized by it, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Remedies and be≈øt way to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd it.</p>
            <p>In applying Comfort, whether generall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt all tentations, or particular again≈øt ≈øome ≈øpeciall troubles or terrours, he is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51481:20"/>to an≈øwer ≈øuch objections, as a troubled heart and afflicted ≈øpirit may ≈øugge≈øt to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>It is al≈øo ≈øometimes requi≈øite to give ≈øome Notes of tryall (which is very profitable, e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when performed by able and experienced Mini≈øters, with circum≈øpection and prudence, and the Signes cleerely grounded on the holy Scripture) whereby the Hearers may be able to examine them≈øelves, whether they have attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned tho≈øe Graces, and performed tho≈øe duties to which he Exhorteth, or be guilty of the ≈øin, Reprehended, and in danger of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Threatned, or are ≈øuch to whom the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolations propounded doe belong; that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they may be quickned and excited to Duty, humbled for their Wants and Sins, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with their Danger, and ≈øtrengthned with Comfort, as their condition upon examination ≈øhall require.</p>
            <p>And, as he needeth not alwayes to pro≈øecute every Doctrine which lies in his Text, ≈øo is he wi≈øely to make choice of ≈øuch V≈øes, as, by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidence and conver≈øing with his flock, he findeth mo≈øt needfull and ≈øea≈øonable: and, among≈øt<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51481:21"/>the≈øe, ≈øuch as may mo≈øt draw their ≈øoules to Chri≈øt, the fountaine of light, holine≈ø≈øe and comfort.</p>
            <p>This Method is not pre≈øcribed as nece≈ø≈øary for every man, or upon every Text; but only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended, as being found by experience to be very much ble≈ø≈øed of God, and very helpfull for the peoples under≈øtandings and memories.</p>
            <p>But the Servant of Chri≈øt, what ever his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod be, is to performe his whole Mini≈øtery;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Painfully, not doing the work of the Lord negligently.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3. Faithfully, looking at the honour of Chri≈øt, the conver≈øion, edification and ≈øalvation of the people, not at his own gaine or glory: keeping<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51481:21"/>nothing back which may promote tho≈øe holy ends, giving to every one his own portion, and bearing indifferent re≈øpect unto all, without neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the meane≈øt, or ≈øparing the greate≈øt in their ≈øins.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Wi≈øely, framing all his Doctrines, Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and e≈øpecially his Reproofs, in ≈øuch a manner as may be mo≈øt likely to prevaile, ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all due re≈øpect to each mans per≈øon and place, and not mixing his own pa≈ø≈øion or bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Gravely, as becometh the Word of God, ≈øhunning all ≈øuch ge≈øture, voice and expre≈ø≈øions as may occa≈øion the corruptions of men to de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øe him and his Mini≈øtry.</p>
            <p n="6">6. With loving affection, that the people may ≈øee all coming from his godly zeale, and hearty de≈øire to doe them good. And</p>
            <p n="7">7. As taught of God, and per≈øwaded in his own heart, that all that he teacheth, is the truth of Chri≈øt; and walking before his flock as an example to them in it; earne≈øtly, both in private and publique, recommending his labours to the ble≈ø≈øing of God, and watchfully looking to him≈øelfe and the flock whereof the Lord hath<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51481:22"/>made him over≈øeer, So ≈øhall the Doctrine of truth be pre≈øerved uncorrupt, many ≈øoules con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and built up, and him≈øelfe receive mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold comforts of his labours, even in this life, and afterward the Crown of Glory laid up for him in the world to come.</p>
            <p>Where there are more Mini≈øters in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation than one, and they of different guifts, each may more e≈øpecially apply him≈øelfe to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Exhortation, according to the guift wherein he mo≈øt excelleth, and as they ≈øhall agree between them≈øelves.</p>

            <p>Marriage is to be betwixt one man and one woman onely; and they, ≈øuch as are not within the degrees of Con≈øanguinity or Affinity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the Word of God.

            <p>At one or both of the publique meetings<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51481:46"/>that day, a Collection is to be made for the poor (and in the like manner upon the Day of Publique Humiliation) that their loynes may ble≈ø≈øe us, and rejoyce the more with us. And the people are to be exhorted at the end of the latter meeting, to ≈øpend the re≈øidue of that Day in holy duties, and te≈øtifications of Chri≈øtian love and charity one towards another, and of rejoycing more and more in the Lord; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth tho≈øe who make the joy of the Lord their ≈øtrength.</p>

            <p>That the whole Congregation may joyne herein, every one that can reade is to have a P≈øalme book, and all others not di≈øabled by age, or otherwi≈øe, are to be exhorted to learn to reade.
